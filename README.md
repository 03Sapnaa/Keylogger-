# Keylogger-
#Project Overview: Keylogger Implementation

Objective:
Create a Python-based keylogger that records keystrokes on a computer. This tool can be used for monitoring purposes or understanding how keyloggers work, with a focus on ethical use and privacy concerns.

Key Features:
Keystroke Logging: Records all keys pressed by the user,
Log File: Saves the recorded keystrokes to a file,
Email Functionality (Optional): Sends the log file to a specified email address at regular intervals,
Stealth Mode: Runs in the background without the user's knowledge (for educational purposes only),

Important Ethical Consideration:
Keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, so it's crucial to only use this project ethically, such as for personal use, parental control, or understanding how such tools work to improve security measures. Never use it to violate someoneâ€™s privacy.

Explanation:
Logging Keystrokes: The program logs every key pressed by the user and saves it to a file named keylog.txt.

Email Functionality (Optional): The code includes an optional feature to send the log file to a specified email address at regular intervals. This is useful for remote monitoring, but should be used ethically.

Stealth Mode: The keylogger runs silently in the background, logging keystrokes without alerting the user. This is for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly.

Periodic Reporting: The report function sends the log file via email every 60 seconds (this interval can be adjusted).
